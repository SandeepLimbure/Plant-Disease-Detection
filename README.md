Plant Disease Detection
Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for detecting plant diseases using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The notebook processes images of plant leaves and classifies them based on their health status, helping in early disease detection and prevention.

Features
Image preprocessing and augmentation
Model training using deep learning (CNNs)
Evaluation and prediction on test images
Visualization of model performance
Installation

Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Plant_Disease_Detection.git
cd Plant_Disease_Detection

Install dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
jupyter notebook Plant_Disease_Detection.ipynb
Follow the steps inside the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate results.

Dataset
The notebook requires a dataset of plant images with labels for different diseases. Ensure you have the dataset in the correct directory and update the notebook accordingly.

Results
